I forked this blog template some time ago now, wanting to post longer form content in here, but unsure for what audience and in what general format.

I started writing what was supposed to be my forst post back at 2024-02-27 with the title "variable declarations in AutoIt", writing my fustrating experience with writing a parser that supports the seemingly well documented and simple case of declaring variables, but ending up being riddled with undocumented cases.
Back then my plan was for this blog to be mostly for the interest of developers working either with AutoIt or parsers in general.
But i could not settle on the perspective or delivery i wanted to present.

So while the post might get written at a later date, for now i will start over.

This blog is mostly for me, or for people interested in my journey.
It will be a log of my thoughts and project notes along the way in a longer format.
A shorter format i plan on being via [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/genius257.bsky.social).

With that in mind, welcome to my journey!
